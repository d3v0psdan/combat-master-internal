# ðŸ”Ž Overview
Combat Master is a tactical FPS free-to-play multiplayer game on steam. Using my current knowledge of reverse engineering and C++ this project is an aim to develop a educational simple internal hack menu for Combat Master.
<b>This project is strictly for educational and learning purposes and is not intended to harm the integrity of the game or anyone playing it.</b>

# ðŸ”— Structure (DLL)
* <h3><b>main.cpp: Everything directx & hooking related happens.</b></h3>
```cpp
// Handle menu & game keyboard inputs.
LRESULT inputHandler(const HWND hWnd, UINT uMsg, WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam);

// Initialize directx variables & handle present hook.
HRESULT presentHooked(IDXGISwapChain* swapChain, UINT sync, UINT flag);

// Initialize variables & hook directx.
DWORD WINAPI MainThread();
```
* <h3><b>menu.cpp: Where everything hacking related is executed.</b></h3>
```cpp
// Initialize & handle GUI/Menu colors/style/theme.
void uiMenu::Styles();

// Handle GUI/Menu rendering
void uiMenu::Render();

// Handles all hacking events even while menu is not open, runs in a constant loop.
void uiMenu::Background();
```

* <h3><b>game.cpp: Where the features/hack variables/functions are defined.</b></h3>
```cpp
// Gets the DLL base address of the module needed to make our features.
uint64_t getDllBase();

// Simple verification to ensure player is in game before allowing features to execute.
void isInGame(bool& value);
void toggleInfiniteAmmo(bool value); // Infinite ammo hack
void toggleInfiniteMag(bool value); // Infinite mag hack
void toggleInfiniteGrenades(bool value); // Infinite grenades hack
void setWorldFov(float value); // Set custom world field of view
void setHandsFov(float value); // Set custom hands field of view
```

# Reverse Engineering

<h3>This project would not have been possible without reverse engineering, so in this section I will dive into how I managed to create different aspects of this project through reverse engineering.</h3>

* <h3><b>Overlay/Directx Hooking:</b></h3>
<h4>One of the most common methods of hooking directx is through obtaining the IDXGISwapChain vtable in dxgi.dll. I personally don't like to use this method because it just takes more effort and personally and there is a much easier way to do it. Whenever you startup a game, especially if through steam. Steam automatically loads their in-game overlay to allow you to manage things through steam easier without tabbing out. We can easily take advantage of this through hooking their overlay that hooks directx. Below are the steps I took to hook it and render my own menu. I would like to say that I am not the first person who has ever done this, people have thought of this much before I have so I just took it upon myself to figure it out without any help since that's what makes it fun.</h4>

1. Open up "GameOverlayRenderer64.dll" in a reverse engineering software of your choice and load up the strings and search for the string `"vtable"`.

2. Once you found the string, I clicked on the first one then cross-referenced it to a function when then I went into.

# ðŸ”— Structure (Injector)
* <h3><b>main.cpp: Simple LoadLibraryA injection.</b></h3>
```cpp
// Error handling function.
void fatalError(std::string message);

// Function to obtain process ID of CombatMaster.
DWORD getPid(const char* processName);

// Function that injects DLL into CombatMaster through obtaining
// processID and DLL path and writing all the data into the process and then
// remotely calling "LoadLibraryA" inside the process. 
int main();
```
* <h3><b>How does this injection method work?:</b></h2>
<h4>Whenever you start up a game, it automatically loads DLL's the game requires. Our DLL/Hack is not natively apart of the game, so we need to forcefully load ours in because the game does not just load ours in for us.</h4>

<h4>How does the game automatically load in it's DLL's? Typically most games will use the function from <b>kernel32.dll</b> called <b>LoadLibraryA</b>(https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/libloaderapi/nf-libloaderapi-loadlibrarya).
So all we need to do is just call that function in order to load in our module! So let's get right into that.
</h4>

<h4>Because we do not have direct access to the games memory, we will need to create our own process which attaches to the game and injects code to remotely call the LoadLibraryA function. So for example, if we had direct access to the games memory (like we were a DLL inside the game) we could simply execute code like this:</h4>

```cpp
#include <Windows.h>

void loadCustomDLL()
{
  auto loadedDLL = LoadLibraryA("C:\\Users\\example\\my_hack.dll");
  if (loadedDLL)
      printf("Loaded DLL! %p\n", loadedDLL);
}

loadCustomDLL();
```

<h4>But since we don't have direct access to the games memory, we need to call this function remotely through injecting memory (known as shellcode) and executing it. Here is how we can achieve this result:</h4>

1. Obtain access to process through opening a handle with all access for reading/writing/executing memory. Using `OpenProcess()`
2. Allocate memory to store our DLL's path, since that is a parameter of LoadLibraryA. Using `VirtualAllocEx()`
3. Write our DLL's path to our allocated memory. Using `WriteProcessMemory()`
4. Execute the `CreateRemoteThread()` function to call LoadLibraryA inside of the process and pass our allocated memory as the starting parameter, so when we call LoadLibraryA we pass the address of our string which is loaded into the games memory.
5. Wait for our DLL to execute it's `DllMain()` using `WaitForSingleObject()`.
6. Close all handles and cleanup memory, using `CloseHandle()` and `VirtualFreeEx()`.
